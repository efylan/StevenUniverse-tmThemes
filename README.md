## Installation

Create a color scheme folder, for example, on your home dir.

	cd ~/
	mkdir colorschemes

Clone this repo on that folder.

	cd colorschemes
	git clone https://github.com/job-s/StevenUniverse-tmThemes.git

And go to Sublime Text's menu option Preferences, Settings - User, and add:

	"color_scheme": "home/youruser/colorschemes/StevenUniverse-tmThemes/HerOwnPearl.tmTheme"

You could also install package control and colorsublime and just cram the .tmTheme files in its theme directory.
